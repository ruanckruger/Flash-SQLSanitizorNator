# SQLSanitizorNator
Performance Considerations:
I am not too happ with looping through the list of words for filtering, want to investigate a way to query the string as an exploded array, though that might not work if using phrases and not just words.

Project Enhancements:
I've added bad word types, for some advanced filtering and data aggregation in future.
I've also added a usage counter to see which bad words get used the most.
I allow users to set how strict they want their filtering to be as well

Tons of other improvements and extra features can be added such as user based usage, user favorite word tracking etc.
